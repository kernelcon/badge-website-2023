      <h3>About The Badge</h3>
      <p>For this year's badge we chose an old school design. A couple years later the component shortage is still real
        y'all.</p>
      <h3>Interesting Bits</h3>
      <p>
        1.5V design (sadly this means most LEDs won't work)<br />
        Based on the TA7642 AM Radio IC<br />
        Hackable design (see the Activities page)<br />
        Has a small transistor amp, which makes it suitable for listening on headphones<br />
        <!--
        Did you know that Spotify has 489 million monthly active listeners?
        I'm pretty sure our Kernelcon AM transmitters would burst into flames if we put that much load on them.
      -->
      </p>
      <h3>RF Gain Knob</h3>
      <p>Worth it's own special mention is the RF Gain knob on the badge. This little beauty dials up or dials down the
        amount of power the RF tuning circuit receives. Why, you ask? This year's badge is an amazingly cheap, quick &
        dirty, unshielded, and non-earth grounded AM radio with a single inductor capacitor tuner. Also, 1110 KFAB
        blasts the entire Omaha metro area with its radio waves.</p>
      <p>The RF Gain knob is actually a bit of a hack in itself. By turning down the power to the RF tuner you can, in
        some cases, achieve better selectivity across the tuner dial. Without this hack, you simply receive 1110 KFAB
        across the whole tuner dial. &lt;sarcasm&gt;I know, I know. Who doesn't love listening to the AM radio equivalent of Fox News?&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
        Has no one put sarcasm tags into the HTML spec yet?
      </p>
      <h3>Schematic</h3>
      <p>Yes. It's a bit hard to read on this page. <a href="badge_schematic.png" target="_blank">Open it in a new
          tab</a> or <a href="badge_schematic.pdf" target="_blank">get a PDF</a>.</p>

      <h3>Super Secret Stuff</h3>
      <p>You've read this far, probably hoping to find some clues on "what's hidden in the badge" or something similar.
        I'm going to let you in on a secret...</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <!-- <img src="spotify_logo.png" /> -->
      <!--
        That's a Spotify logo BTW. Isn't it cool looking?
        It's a bit like someone wanted to be creative, just couldn't manage it, hit the project deadline, then quickly ripped off the Wi-Fi logo in a spectacularly lame way.
        I feel bad for whoever hired the design firm to make it. They could have given the intern 4 beers and gotten a better design.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Nothing. There's absolutely nothing hidden <i>inside</i> the badge. There's no microcontroller. No flash
        storage.
        It's an old school analog design.</p>
      <p>If you aren't happy with this response, I don't blame you. Badge challenges are fun. Did I mention that we've
        still got badge challenges? Drop by the Kernelcon CTF to find out more.</p>
